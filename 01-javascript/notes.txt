// var has global and functional scope

// the scope rules for const variables are exactly same as let variables

//const variable has to be instantiated when it is declared
//we can change the properties of the object defined by const but cannot change the entire object.
//array destructuring and object destructuring

// spread operator or rest parameter "..."

//rest parameter collects all remaining elements into array
//spread operator --> inverse operation of rest
//spread operator --> allow iterables like arrays, objects, strings to be expanded into single arguments/elements.
//we can also use spread operator to copy but it copies primitives (number, boolean, string) by values and rest by references.

//A Reducer must be a "pure function"
// A "pure function" does not make use/change any global variables
    //does not change incoming arguments
    //must return the same output for same combination of arguments
